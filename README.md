# Stockerface
The general idea is to analyze stock data. One day in some future we hope to make this into a trading robot. For now, to get code done, its mostly important to have fun and build something interesting.  

## Live server
Code is continuously deployed to https://qwde.no. Its a droplet with 4vCPU and 16 GB RAM. If you want access, send me an email or PM.

Pull- and feature-requests welcome! :smile:

The main requirements for any PR is that the tests still run. In general there will be no thorough code review unless you explicitly ask for it. This is to make it easier to "just fix things" and avoid the corporate procedures we normally go through 9 to 5. At least until the project is of a certain size.

Also, to speed up development, the policy is that all code can be moved around, refactored or deleted. As long as the tests run.
