# Qwde frontend
There's two applications here, one `client` that takes Haskell code to javascript, and one `server` that can work backend to get data. The `client` needs to be compiled with ghcjs, and the `server` needs to be compiled with ghc.

To build I recommend getting nix, or you can use the docker image (`docker build`)
