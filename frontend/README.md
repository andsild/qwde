There's two applications here, one `client` that takes Haskell code to javascript, and one `server` that can work backend to get data (from the `../backend`). The `client` needs to be compiled with ghcjs, and the `server` needs to be compiled with ghc.

To build I recommend [getting nix](https://nixos.org/download.html), or you can use the docker image (`docker build`)
